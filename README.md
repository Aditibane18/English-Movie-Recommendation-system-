# English-Movie-Recommendation-system-
## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user input and recommend English movies that match their tastes. By leveraging natural language processing and collaborative filtering techniques, the system generates accurate and tailored recommendations for each user.
## Features
- Personalized Recommendations: Receive movie suggestions based on your preferences.
- User Interaction: Engage with the system through a user-friendly interface.
- Scalability: The system can handle a large volume of users and movies efficiently.
- Customization: Tailor recommendations by adjusting parameters and preferences.
## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies:
- Pandas: Data manipulation library for handling movie datasets.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for implementing recommendation algorithms.
## Customizing Dataset

Users have the flexibility to change the dataset according to their requirements. If you need to use a different dataset or update the existing one, follow these steps:

1. **Replace Dataset:** Replace the current dataset file with your preferred dataset. Ensure that the new dataset follows the same format and structure as the original.
2. **Update Configuration:** If necessary, update the configuration or settings to reflect the changes made to the dataset.
3. **Rebuild and Run:** After updating the dataset and configurations, rebuild the system and run it to incorporate the changes effectively.

By allowing users to customize the dataset, this project enables greater flexibility and adaptability to different use cases and preferences.
